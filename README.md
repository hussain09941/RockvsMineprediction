# Rock vs Mine Prediction using SONAR DATA
## Project overview
This project aims to classify underwater objects as **ROCK** " or **MINE** unsig sonar signal data .
I have use the "LOGISTIC REGRESSION" model used for binary classification.

### DATASET###
In the Sonar Dataset  label data set which is availble on Kaggle there is **208** tuple and **61 coulumn(feature)**
Target have to classify :ROCK(R) ,MINE(M) 
### Technology uesd ###
python
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Google Colab
## Model used#
Logistic regression
## Model Performance
Training Accuracy:  **0.8342245989304813 (83.42%)**
Accuracy on test data :  **0.7619047619047619(76.1%)**
## How to run 
open the notbook in Goolge Colab
upload the dataset
Run all cells sequnetially

## Conclusion
The Model perfomrs well on unseen SONAR data.Performance can be imporoved furhter using advanced classifire like SVM.
